# Code Lads

This is a collaborative plain code editor that depends on 
ShareDB and Ace Code Editor. 

In this demo, data is not persisted. To persist data, run a Mongo
server and initialize ShareDB with the
[ShareDBMongo](https://github.com/share/sharedb-mongo) database adapter.

## Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

## Build JavaScript bundle and run server
```
node app.js
```

## Run app in browser
Load [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Alternatively, there is a heroku url that you can
